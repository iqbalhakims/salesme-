## User Access Control

The system has two distinct areas:

| Area | URL | Access |
|------|-----|--------|
| **Customer site** | `/` | Public — no login, always accessible |
| **Admin panel** | `/admin/login` | Staff login required |

### Permissions

Staff accounts have four independently toggleable permissions:

| Permission | Color | What it controls in the admin panel |
|-----------|-------|--------------------------------------|
| **Read** | Green | Can log in and view all data. Required — without it the account is blocked |
| **Create** | Blue | Can add cars, leads, and appointments |
| **Edit** | Amber | Can edit records and change car status |
| **Delete** | Red | Can delete cars, leads, and records |

The `admin` account (seeded from `.env` on startup) always has full access and cannot be modified or deleted.

### Admin startup seeding

On every server start, `seedAdmin()`:
1. Runs `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users` — safe to run on existing containers
2. Checks if the admin username from `.env` exists
3. If not, inserts it with a bcrypt-hashed password and full permissions

This means **you can never lose admin access** even if you restart the container or the `users` table is missing.

---

## System Monitor

Accessible via the **System** tab in the admin panel. All data is collected in-process — no external agents required.

### Dashboards

| Section | Metrics |
|---------|---------|
| **Infrastructure** | CPU usage %, load average (1/5/15m), RAM used %, Node.js heap % |
| **API Traffic** | Requests per minute (bar chart), 4xx/5xx error overlay, avg response latency |
| **Database** | Avg query latency, P95 latency, slow query count (>100ms) + timestamps |
| **Upload Storage** | Disk used (MB), file count, avg MB per file |

### How it works

- **6-hour rolling window** — up to 7,200 data points at 3-second polling intervals
- **Downsampled to 300 points** for SVG rendering (no chart library dependency)
- **Hourly x-axis timestamps** on all line and bar charts
- **Color thresholds** — metrics turn amber >60% and red >85%
- **DB latency** — `pool.query` is wrapped to record every query duration; slow queries (>100ms) are stored separately with timestamps
- **API metrics** — Express middleware records status code and latency into per-minute buckets

---

## Known Issues & Troubleshooting

This section documents real bugs encountered during development of the user management module and how each was resolved.

---

### 1. Cars not showing on homepage after user module was added

**Symptom:** The public homepage showed no cars. The admin panel was also unreachable. All API routes returned connection errors.

**Root cause:** The `users` table was added to `init.sql`, which MySQL only executes on the very first container creation. On an already-running container the table never got created. When the server started, `seedAdmin()` tried to query `SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = ?` — the table didn't exist, so it threw an error before `app.listen()` was ever called. Because the server never started listening, **all routes failed**, including the public `GET /api/cars` endpoint the homepage depends on.

**Fix:** `seedAdmin()` now runs `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users` itself before querying it, making it safe regardless of whether the container is new or existing:

```js
// authController.js — runs on every server startup
async function seedAdmin() {
  await pool.query(`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users ( ... )`);
  // then check and insert admin row
}
```

**Lesson:** Never rely solely on `init.sql` for schema changes on a live container. Any new table that is queried at startup must be created defensively with `IF NOT EXISTS` in application code.

---

### 2. "View" permission confused with public car browsing

**Symptom:** When building the user permission system, naming the first permission "View" was ambiguous — customers already "view" cars on the public site without any login. Staff reviewing the Users page assumed "View" controlled what customers could see.

**Root cause:** Poor naming. The permission was meant to control whether a staff account could log in to the admin panel and read CRM data — not anything related to the public site.

**Fix:** Renamed the permission from `View` to `Read` and added a clear banner at the top of the Users page:

> **Admin Panel Access Only** — these users log in at `/admin/login` to manage the CRM. The public customer site (`/`) is always open with no login required.

The two areas are completely separate:
- `/` — public, no authentication, customers browse cars freely
- `/admin/login` — internal staff only, controlled by `Read / Create / Edit / Delete` permissions

---

### 3. JSX syntax error — cars page broke after permission guard was added

**Symptom:** After conditionally hiding the "Add Car" form for users without `create` permission, the React app crashed with:

```
JSX expressions must have one parent element.
'}' expected.
```

**Root cause:** The conditional render was written as `{perms.create && <div className="card">...</div>}` but the closing `}` was placed after the next sibling `<div>`, leaving both elements sharing the same conditional expression without a parent wrapper.

**Fix:** Closed the conditional immediately after the form div, before the inventory list div:

```jsx
{perms.create && <div className="card">
  {/* Add Car form */}
</div>}   {/* ← closing } was missing here */}

<div className="card">
  {/* Car Inventory — always visible */}
</div>
```

---

### 4. Admin account could be deleted or permission-stripped

**Symptom** (caught during development, before it could occur in production): The user delete and permission-update endpoints initially had no guard against modifying the `admin` role account. A staff user with delete access could theoretically call `DELETE /api/users/1` and remove the only admin.

**Fix:** Both `remove` and `updatePerms` in `userController.js` check the target user's role before acting:

```js
if (user.role === 'admin') {
  return res.status(403).json({ success: false, message: 'Cannot delete the admin account' });
}
```

The frontend also renders the admin row as read-only with no action buttons.

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:

```env
# Server
PORT=3000

# Database
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_NAME=carcrm

# Admin credentials (seeded into users table on startup)
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password

# JWT signing secret
JWT_SECRET=your_supersecret_jwt_key
```

> For Docker deployments these are injected via `docker-compose.yml` and GitHub Actions secrets.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- MySQL 8
- Docker & Docker Compose (for containerised setup)

---

### Local Development

#### 1. Database

Start a MySQL 8 instance and run the initialisation script:

```bash
mysql -u root -p < init.sql
```

#### 2. Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env     # fill in your values
npm run dev              # starts with nodemon on port 3000
```

On startup the server will:
- Wait for the DB to be ready
- Create the `users` table if missing
- Seed the admin user from `.env` if not already present

#### 3. Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
PORT=3007 npm start      # starts on localhost:3007, proxies /api → localhost:3000
```

---

### Docker (Production)

Build and start all services with a single command:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

| Service | Exposed Port |
|---------|-------------|
| Frontend (Nginx) | `80` |
| Backend (Express) | `3000` |
| MySQL | internal only |

Uploaded files are stored in the `uploads_data` Docker volume, shared between the backend container and Nginx.

To stop and remove all volumes:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

The workflow at [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) triggers on every push to `main`:

1. **Build & Push** — Builds Docker images and pushes to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR):
   - `ghcr.io/iqbalhakims/salesme-frontend:latest`
   - `ghcr.io/iqbalhakims/salesme-backend:latest`

2. **Deploy** — SSHs into a DigitalOcean Droplet and:
   - Pulls the latest images
   - Writes a `.env` from GitHub Secrets
   - Runs `docker compose up -d`

### Required GitHub Secrets

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `DROPLET_HOST` | IP or hostname of the DigitalOcean Droplet |
| `DROPLET_USER` | SSH username |
| `DROPLET_SSH_KEY` | Private SSH key |
| `GHCR_TOKEN` | GitHub token with `read:packages` scope |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | MySQL root password |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | Admin login username |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Admin login password |
| `JWT_SECRET` | JWT signing secret |

---

## Testing

### Unit Tests (Jest)

```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

### E2E Tests (Cypress)

The frontend must be running on `localhost:3007` and the backend on `localhost:3000`.

```bash
cd frontend

# Interactive mode (opens Cypress UI)
npm run cy:open

# Headless (CI)
npm run cy:run

# Headless with browser visible
npm run cy:run:headed
```

#### Test Specs

| Spec | Coverage |
|------|----------|
| `01-public.cy.js` | Homepage load, car listing, unknown route redirect, car detail navigation |
| `02-auth.cy.js` | Login page UI, invalid credentials, valid login, auth redirect, logout |
| `03-admin-cars.cy.js` | Add car, change car status, tab navigation |
| `04-admin-leads.cy.js` | Add lead, change lead status |

### Load Tests (K6)

Requires [K6](https://k6.io/docs/get-started/installation/) installed.

```bash
# Smoke test — 1 VU for 30 seconds
k6 run k6/smoke-test.js

# Stress test
k6 run k6/stress-test.js
```

Covers: health check, login, car listing, and lead listing endpoints.

---

## Monitoring

Prometheus scrape targets are defined in [`monitoring/prometheus.yml`](monitoring/prometheus.yml):

- `node-exporter` — host-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
- `mysqld-exporter` — MySQL metrics
- Backend `/metrics` endpoint

The in-app **System Monitor** (admin panel → System tab) provides real-time dashboards without any external tooling — useful during development and for quick health checks in production.

---

## Frontend Routes

| Path | Access | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | Public | Car listing homepage |
| `/cars/:id` | Public | Car detail page |
| `/book` | Public | Appointment booking |
| `/admin/login` | Public | Staff login |
| `/admin/*` | Protected | Admin panel (requires JWT) |

---

## Demo Access

A read-only guest account is available for exploring the admin panel:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **URL** | `/admin/login` |
| **Username** | `guest` |
| **Password** | `guestguest` |

This account has **Read-only** permission — it can view all data but cannot create, edit, or delete anything.

---

## Security Notes

- Passwords are hashed with **bcrypt** (10 rounds) before storage.
- All admin routes are protected with **JWT Bearer token** middleware.
- The `admin` role is protected — its permissions and account cannot be modified via the API.
- Database queries use **parameterised statements** to prevent SQL injection.
- CORS is enabled; restrict the `origin` to your frontend domain in production.
- Change all default secrets (`JWT_SECRET`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `DB_PASSWORD`) before deploying.
